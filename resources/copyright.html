<p>This is the fifth major draft of this document since 2009.</p>
<ul class="incremental">
<li><strong><a href="https://sdiehl.github.io/wiwinwlh/">HTML Version</a></strong></li>
<li><strong><a href="https://sdiehl.github.io/wiwinwlh/tutorial.pdf">Screen PDF</a></strong></li>
</ul>
<p>I no longer actively support this document, but I will leave it up on Github for
posterity and for historical record. The code is likely quite out of date
compared to modern versions of both GHC and the libraries covered.
